**Tools employed:** 
- R-CNN model trained on custom annotated dataset by experts, performing phase identification and pupil tracking (Python, Pytorch + TorchVision);
- OpenCV employed for optical flow tracking of features and visual feedback;
- Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization.

**Tools employed:** 
- OpenCV employed for optical flow tracking of features and visual feedback;
- Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization applied in the pupil area for better visualization of tissues;
- Tools and tissues movement coordinates extracted: data generated for future ML models.
