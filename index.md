- Convolutional Neural Networks for real-time surgical phase identification;
- OpenCV employed for optical flow tracking of features and visual feedback;
- Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization applied in the pupil area for better visualization of tissues;
- Tools and tissues movement coordinates extracted: data generated for future ML models.
